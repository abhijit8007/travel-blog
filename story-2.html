        <p> "What makes Iceland a great travel destination, apart from the culture and people that live in the country, is our spectacular nature. Although many of the things you’ll see in Iceland are not necessarily unique in the world (although some of it is) what makes Iceland so special is that all these amazing things are right here in one spot in an area about the of the size of Kentucky."<br> <br> <br>
            Iceland is not just about its amazing landscapes; one of my closest friends is Icelandic (and happens to own a great tour company by the way) and I feel like there’s a very special kind of energy that emanates from the breathtaking nature in the country. Maybe this all sounds like mumbo-jumbo but believe me, once you have seen it for yourself, you might believe it too.
            <br>For the adventurous nature lover, Iceland is chock-full of once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as hiking on a glacier on the south coast, exploring a lava tube cave, relaxing in geothermal springs (the purest form of bliss), driving through the magnificent Snaefellsnes Peninsula, seeing the Northern Lights, and spending time in Reykjavik, a cool city that is still getting used to all the tourists. Got limited time to travel around Iceland? Here’s a 6-day South Iceland self-drive itinerary to see the highlights.
             In Iceland, you will be spending most of your time outdoors, how can you not? You’ll hike on glaciers and watch in fascination as geysers erupt, you’ll find peace in a hot spring and stare at the rainbow that arches over Skogafoss, and you’ll never tire of chasing the Northern Lights even when it feels like your fingers might freeze and fall off. So good quality clothes fit for activities and adventures, waterproof hiking shoes and camera gear that is fit for cold weather and activities are a must.
            If you plan to camp outdoors, then bring camping gear and sleeping bags. Buying it in the country can be insanely expensive.
            If you’re visiting in winter, thick warm jackets, beanies, thermals, layers, scarves, gloves, socks etc need to be carried.
            Don’t count on ‘getting it there if you need it’ because this stuff is expensive in the country.
            Even if you’re visiting in summer, you still need a warm jacket, beanie, scarf, sweater, and good hiking shoes. Iceland summer is not as warm as summer elsewhere.
            Other than the obvious things like clothes and shoes for the city (stress on comfort over style), here is a detailed list of things to pack for Iceland. I have mentioned only some of these briefly below.
