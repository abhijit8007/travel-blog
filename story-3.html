        <p> Sunderban National Park Blog
            Sunderban is everything Robert Frost in his famous poem describes - lovely, dark, and deep. A tiger reserve, national park, and a biosphere reserve, it is home to opulent wildlife of which tigers make an essential part. A haven of many enthralling tiger tales, Sunderban also boasts a unique ecosystem as well as being the largest coastal mangrove in the world. Named after the Sundari Trees that are ubiquitous here, this national park in West Bengal is indeed an ideal destination to go on a wildlife tour, and by no means an ordinary one but the one that requires a boat or a cruise. The impenetrable forest that can only be accessed through an intricate system of canals and streams, Sunderban National Park indeed makes for an experience that you are unlikely to find anywhere in the world.

            I always love long boat ride. So when my friend Avijit told me he has a work in Sundarban and it’s a long boat journey, if I wish I can join with him. I did not even take a second to reply yes. Yes Sundarban I am coming. Next morning I boarded a Train from my nearest railway station and Avijit joined me after some stations. Within one hour we reached Canning, the nearest rail head of Godkhali,the gateway of Sundarban. Godkhali is only one hour further journey from Canning. Bus,Auto, Hired vehicle are available in Canning for Godkhali. We booked an Auto ad reached Godkhali. As our boat was prebooked  So we also didn’t even  waste a single time and started our journey through river network.

            Within not more than 15 minute I felt the essence of Sundarban and understood why this called world largest Delta and mangrove forest. Our boat was running through a river, both side of the river was densely covered by mangrove trees. Some villages were also there in the forest. On our journey we passed many villages. Interestingly where the population is high forest was becoming thin. Here people are living with nature. River is only way of transportation. Interestingly on our journey some time our water-way became narrow sometime became wide. It’s a common fact of Sundarban water channel.Now we are in a narrow river in the interior part of Sundarban. Our boat was running simultaneously with continuous ‘dug-dug’ sound. Time was passing fast like both sides view. Sun was on the top. In this winter noon here we were facing chilled breeze. Our boatman told us “Sundarban is famous for its Royal Bengal Tiger but it’s not a place to just move on and expect meeting ‘His highness’ any time”. Yes this is a genuine fact. Very few lucky among the lots of Sundarban visitors get a chance to see Royal Bengal tiger to its own land. We were still going, on our way we passed many small boats. Fishing is a part of life here. We found many in the interior part. After 3hours long journey we finally reached our destination. After living our boat we entered in a village called Sodhakhali.

            Life here is governed by the rise and fall in tide. I started conversation with villagers. I came to know  most of school in Sundarban have boarding facility. Still due to lack of connectivity most of the school has very less students. I spend one hour with villagers. In between my friend also completed his work.
            
            So it was time to return. Again it’s a long boat journey back. Sun was already started to setting in the West. Sky was becoming reddish. We saw many different types of birds on our return. Most of them are Grey Heron, Kingfisher, Sand Pipit,flame back, King fisher. Temperature was also getting down. From our boat we saw a glimpse sunset.I found water network became much busier than noon. Like me everybody was returning home. Again after three hours journey we finally reached from where we started. It was a nice journey.

            At the end of day I realized Sundarban blessed us with its greenery,birds,people,rivers. Every where in Sundarban people will talk about Tiger. You will always feel here something is watchin you from the jungle, sometime as a killer, sometime as an almighty. Tiger in Sundarban is treat like the God, the almighty, the survivor.
