        <p>Beautiful beach and stunning viewpoint. You will need to access steep and unsafe steps to get to the beach and sand.
            The beach is NOT swimmable; there are rip currents visible from the top of the cliff.Diamond Beach is located a bit further away from all the famous tourist attractions on the island and the port. You can find it on the eastern part of Nusa Penida, right near Atuh Beach and Rumah Pohon Tree House.

            If you decide to visit Diamond Beach, make sure to also visit Atuh Beach. Keep in mind to set Diamond Beach as your GPS destination. From this parking lot, you can easily access both beaches.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
            Road to diamond beach has a very bumpy, dangerous stretch of unpaved road for about 5 KM, go very slowly or walk your scooter when you reach these broken roads. Sunscreen recommended as there isn’t a lot of shade around.
            If there’s one beach I’d like to go back and visit again in all of Bali, it would be this. Diamond Beach in Nusa Penida. Diamond Beach located on east of Nusa Penida is an untouched, white sand beach with minimal crowd. If you love beaches and just want to hang out and enjoy a couple of hours looking at a gorgeous view, then this is the perfect place to do that.

            When I researched Nusa Penida while planning my trip to Bali, I read a lot of people recommending east Nusa Penida specifically for Diamond Beach. The only problem was, east Nusa Penida had only two major spots to offer.If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Bali beaches, it’s this. Every beach is a significant hike up and down. We parked our car in a parking lot which was about a 5-7 minute walk to the beach road.When you walk towards Diamond beach, initially you can’t see the beach as you’re walking right on top of the hill. The view of the beach opens up as you walk maybe 10 minutes and both Atuh and Diamond Beach open up side by side. It’s like three big hills next to each other with two valley points that are Atuh & Diamond Beach. Not sure if that makes much sense.So because you’re on the hill top, for reaching these ocean waters, you need to walk down to the beach. Unfortunately, Diamond Beach is a pretty messed up walk. The route is not well constructed, and in some places, you have to simply hold on to the rope and make your way down. It’s a scary walk and if you have vertigo or any height issues, I wouldn’t recommend taking this on.

            The walk down to the beach can take you anywhere from 30-45 mins one way. At any point, the steps allow only one way traffic. So you might have to wait a bit to let the other person up first before you walk down.Unfortunately no. The sea is quite rough here, and you should only go down during low tides. We landed at Diamond beach sometime post noon, and the water seemed ok then. There are also hardly any locals down here, so you don’t want to get into any trouble, as help is not easily available. What you can do instead is walk around the rocks, soak your feet in the water and just enjoy the sun. There’s a cave nearby where you can lounge and escape the sun when it gets too hot.

            There was one thing that was puzzling about these beaches. The water near Diamond Beach was bone chilling cold. It was tough to stay wet on this beach. But Atuh Beach which was right next door had perfectly luke warm water. I don’t know what caused it, maybe the angle of the sun at that point, or something else. It was quite interesting.On the island of Nusa Penida near Bali, lies one of the most beautiful beaches you have ever seen. One that came straight from the postcards. Diamond Beach is an untouched, white-sand, and silky blue water bay on the eastern tip of Nusa Penida. With the, in 2018, almost finished stairs, Diamond Beach is ready to become one of the next highlights of Penida island and one of the best things to do on Nusa Penida.The view from the top on Diamond Beach is one directly from the postcards. A stunning white beach, silky blue water, limestones, and palm trees are creating a dream destination. Diamond Beach is without a doubt one of the things you must do on Bali.
