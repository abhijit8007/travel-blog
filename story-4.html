        <p>There is absolutely no doubt that winter months are the best time for holidays. So, if you are planning for a winter vacation, that would take you far from the monotony of everyday life, then Rann of Kutch should be your choice. Situated in the Kutch district of Gujarat, the great Rann of Kutch is a crowd puller between the months of December to February. The white Rann of Kutch looks at its mesmerizing best during the winters. With a favourable weather and a cultural extravaganza on offer, there are plenty of reasons to visit Rann of Kutch this winter.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
            We had taken the train around 4 in the evening from Gurgaon on 21 st Jan and reached Ahmedabad around 9 the next morning. We had our breakfast at the station itself and taken the bus around 12:30 in the afternoon for Bhuj.

            We reached Bhuj in the night, and the journey in the Volvo bus was really comfortable because of the well-maintained roads in Gujarat. I never had such an experience of any bus travel(the bus was from Patel Tour and Travels).We checked into Gangaram Hotel in Bhuj and ate delicious authentic Gujarati Thali at Annapurna Hotel (which was near our hotel only). The Thali was delicious.

            Also, the widespread myth about the Gujarati food that everything is sweet was broken there. We booked a car for all the three days to have easy travel and also to enjoy the road journey. The car was arranged by the hotel owner itself.
            
            What I liked: the famous Gujarati Thali which is said to have everything sweet but that’s not actually true so, give it a try if you are a foodie like me.We started with an NGO at Sumeraser. The knitting by the artisan(Karigar) there was enthralling. They call that skill(Warp and Weft) “Tana – Bana”.

            I was amazed by the patience level with which he was weaving. Hence, the whole process of getting the cotton from animals, dyeing it, spinning, designing was being done by him and he has been succeeding this skill after his father.They cannot do this task after the late thirties as their eyesight gets weak due to knitting, but then they are given some other work which does not require that much vision. What I loved about these NGOs is that they are providing a sustainable source of income to the women and making them skilled.

            We took leave from them after some time and went ahead. We had to stop at a check post for taking the permit to enter Kutch, so if you are planning to visit Kutch don’t forget to carry your Government ID Proof.
            
            After that, we went to KaloDungar which known as is the highest point in Gujarat. The “360-degree view” from there was just breathtaking. We went to Khavda from there, had yummy Gujarati snacks called gaathiya and jalebi.
            
            After that, we saw pottery at Khavda, which was good. From there, we left for Rann of Kutch immediately as we did not want to miss the sunset from there.
